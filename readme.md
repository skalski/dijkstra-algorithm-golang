A small implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm written in golang, for single-source shortest paths in a distance weighted directed graph.

It's a very small implementation for cure of my curiosity how to figure out in golang.

More Information abot the algorithm:

If you search for a java implementation example - take a look at my other repos.
